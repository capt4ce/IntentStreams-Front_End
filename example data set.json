It has an Old Portuguese Fort and a 17th century church overlooking a peaceful unexplored beach with calm shore.  The fort, now converted to a hotel, can be reached by a ferry which plies every half an hour.

The beach has paragliding and other water sports. However it is not safe for swimming especially near the Tiracol estuary (formed by the Tiracol river meeting the Arabian Sea).

The steep descent and climb required owes much to its appeal, attracting only adventurous weekenders and die-hard surfers favouring its uncrowded waves and exotic location. Also among the inimitable features at Green Bowl Beach are two large limestone caves that enclose small rock shrines, and which also provide shade and shelter for beach goers and surfers paddling in from their fun time out on the waves. The best time to go is during low tide, when the calm crystal clear waters allow for great snorkelling, with the fairly consistent waves a short paddle beyond a natural reef barrier.",
